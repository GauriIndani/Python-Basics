1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer : True and False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer : and , or, not
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer : and 
	Input1		Input2		Output
	True		True		True
	True		False		False
	False		True		False
	False		False		False
	or
	Input1		Input2		Output
	True		True		True
	True		False		True
	False		True		True
	False		False		False
	Not
	Input1		output
	True		False
	False		True
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) --> False
not (5 > 4) --> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) --> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) --> False
(True and True) and (True == False) --> False
(not False) or (not True) --> True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer : > , < ,>= ,<= ,== !=
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Answer : Equal to operator will make the comparison of operand 1 and operand 2 while Assignment operator will assign the values to the operand.
example: 3 == 5 --> when we need to compare two values we use equal to operator
         a = 5 --> Assigned the value to the operand.
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Answer : ham
         spam
	 spam
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints

if spam == 1:
	print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
	print('Howdy')
